# Authentication Debug Report

## Core Issues Found:
1. **Session vs. Backend Mismatch**: Supabase has a valid session but backend APIs fail
2. **Navigation Issues**: After login, the app doesn't properly navigate
3. **DOM Nesting Warning**: `<a>` tags nested inside other `<a>` tags in Navbar
4. **Error Handling**: Generic error handling doesn't provide enough details

## Proposed Solutions:
1. Make auth token available to backend requests
2. Implement direct location change instead of React router
3. Fix Navbar component's DOM structure  
4. Add comprehensive logging throughout auth flow

## Implementation Priorities:
1. Focus on Quick Login functionality first (direct path)
2. Ensure tokens are properly passed in API requests
3. Add backup user data to localStorage for fallback
