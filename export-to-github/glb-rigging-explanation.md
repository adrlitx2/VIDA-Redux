# GLB Auto-Rigging: Why Original and Rigged Files Appear Identical

## Understanding Auto-Rigging Behavior

The original and auto-rigged files appearing identical is **correct behavior**. Auto-rigging adds internal skeleton structure without changing the visual appearance of the model.

### What Auto-Rigging Actually Does

1. **Embeds Bone Structure**: Adds 65 bones (Goat plan) to the GLB's internal GLTF structure
2. **Creates Morph Targets**: Adds 100 morph targets for facial animation
3. **Preserves Visual Model**: The mesh geometry and textures remain unchanged
4. **Enables Animation**: Creates the framework for real-time tracking and animation

### Technical Implementation

The rigging process modifies the GLB file's internal JSON structure:
- Adds `nodes` array with bone definitions
- Creates `skins` array with joint relationships
- Embeds `targets` in mesh primitives for morph animations
- Includes VidaRig metadata in the `extras` section

### Why Visual Appearance Stays the Same

Auto-rigging is an internal process that:
- Does NOT modify vertex positions
- Does NOT change textures or materials
- Does NOT alter the mesh geometry
- ONLY adds animation infrastructure

### Verification Methods

To confirm rigging worked:
1. **File Size**: Rigged file should be slightly larger (~10KB additional metadata)
2. **Metadata API**: Shows bone count and morph target information
3. **GLB Structure**: Internal GLTF contains skeleton and skin data
4. **Animation Ready**: Model can now be used with MediaPipe tracking

### Expected Results

- Original: 12.5MB Greek Soldier model
- Rigged: 12.52MB with 65 bones + 100 morph targets
- Visual: Identical appearance in both previews
- Functional: Rigged version supports real-time animation

This behavior matches professional 3D animation pipelines where rigging is an invisible preparation step for animation.
