# Co-Stream Grid Architecture & Implementation Checklist

## 1. Grid Rendering
- [ ] Use a single grid component for both host and co-hosts.
- [ ] Each tile uses the same rendering logic/component (e.g., StreamingCanvas or ParticipantTile).
- [ ] The hostâ€™s preview is just the first tile in the grid.
- [ ] Grid layout (2x2, 3x3, etc.) is dynamic and adapts to participant count.

## 2. State Management
- [ ] Maintain a shared state for all participants (background, avatar, camera, etc.).
- [ ] Sync state via WebSocket or Realtime DB (Supabase, etc.).
- [ ] When a participant updates their background/avatar, broadcast to all.
- [ ] Handle joining/leaving participants and update the grid accordingly.

## 3. Live Preview
- [ ] Each participant sees a live preview of the full grid, including themselves.
- [ ] All changes (background, avatar, camera) are reflected in real-time for everyone.
- [ ] Each tile can show loading/error states for background/avatar/camera.

## 4. Streaming Output
- [ ] The host streams the composed grid canvas to RTMP (or other output).
- [ ] The output matches what the host sees in their preview.
- [ ] Optionally, allow previewing the output before going live.

## 5. Edge Cases
- [ ] Handle joining/leaving participants (grid updates dynamically).
- [ ] Handle background/avatar loading states and errors.
- [ ] Handle camera/mic permissions and errors.
- [ ] Fallbacks for missing avatars/backgrounds.

## 6. UX
- [ ] Allow each participant to verify their setup before going live.
- [ ] Provide clear feedback if something is not working (e.g., camera not detected).
- [ ] Easy controls for changing background, avatar, and camera/mic.
- [ ] Visual indicators for who is speaking, muted, or has issues.

## 7. Code Organization & Modularity
- [ ] Use a unified ParticipantTile or StreamingCanvas component for all grid cells.
- [ ] Keep grid logic (layout, participant assignment) in a dedicated module/component.
- [ ] Separate state management (context, hooks, or store) from UI rendering.
- [ ] Modularize WebSocket/realtime sync logic for easy testing and extension.
- [ ] Document all props and state flows for maintainability.
